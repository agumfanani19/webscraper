Why Stellantis was the only automaker to advertise during Super Bowl 59,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/10/super-bowl-59-ad-stellantis-automaker.html,Autos,Feb 10 20251:20 PM EST,"
DETROIT — A CEO's exit, electric vehicles making the industry run around like ""headless chickens"" and a company's U.S. revival all came together to make Ram and Jeep parent Stellantis the only automaker with a Super Bowl 59 commercial.
That's according to Stellantis Chief Marketing Officer Olivier Francois, who said while other automakers abandoned this year's big game amid industry uncertainty and cost cutting, it was critical for the embattled trans-Atlantic carmaker to return to the Super Bowl.
Francois said Stellantis Chairman John Elkann, a scion of Italy's Fiat carmaker, called him after CEO Carlos Tavares' abrupt departure in December and told him to advertise during the big game as a recommitment to the automaker's business in the U.S.
""We were not set to make a commercial. John Elkann called me in December, saying, you know, 'I want something. I want to make a comeback. We want to show, to express, that comeback story. We want to show America how much it is important to the Stellantis group,'"" Francois told CNBC.
Stellantis, formerly known as Fiat Chrysler, has become well known under Francois for symbolic, nontraditional ads that feature iconic celebrities that tell a story beyond just attempting to sell new cars and trucks.
It started when the automaker was attempting to make a comeback from its 2009 bankruptcy. It aired a surprise two-minute Super Bowl ad in 2011 featuring rapper Eminem and the city of Detroit — tying the company's revival to the Motor City's grit and rebirth. The ad also featured a now discontinued Chrysler sedan called the 200.
Francois said Elkann, who's leading the search for a new CEO, told him to recapture that kind of ""comeback"" spirit for the automaker, following years of cost cutting and lackluster sales in the U.S.
Elkann, Francois said, also told him to think of the late Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne when creating the automaker's ads this year. Marchionne, who died in 2018, was a supporter of Francois and past Super Bowl ads.
""There is a kind of philosophy attached to Sergio, which is that he believed in playing like you have nothing left to lose. He used to say, 'Mediocrity is not worth the trip,'"" Francois said. ""So this year's Super Bowl creative execution and investment are very much the essence of the spirit.""
Since Eminem, the company's Super Bowl ads have featured actors such as Clint Eastwood, Bill Murray and singer Bob Dylan, among others. Those spots haven't necessarily prominently featured any specific vehicle, but they've discussed culturally relevant topics such as political divides and patriotism.
Stellantis' Ram Trucks ad this year was a more traditional, comedic Super Bowl commercial. It starred ""Twisters"" and ""Top Gun: Maverick"" actor Glen Powell reimagining ""Goldilocks and the Three Bears"" with trucks.
But the automaker's two-minute Jeep ad starring featuring ""Star Wars"" and ""Indiana Jones"" actor Harrison Ford was a true return to form for Francois.
Francois said Ford turned down an initial pitch for a different ad. That's when Francois said he and friend Edward Razek, a former marketing executive for Victoria's Secret owner L Brands who resigned amid controversy in 2019, wrote the first version of the ad that aired.
CMOs don't typically write scripts. It's more common for those executives to approve a script from an agency, with guidance. Francois said agencies did assist ahead of the final ad, but the script and ideas started inside the automaker.
In the ad, Ford discusses freedom, heroes and people writing their own stories in life because there is no ""Owner's Manual,"" which is the title of the commercial.
As Ford opined, several Jeep models can be seen driving and off-roading, including one that passes a Ford Bronco SUV — a newer competitor to the Jeep Wrangler SUV — while the actor talks about inspiring others.
""I said 'yes' to doing this commercial because of the script. It's a very straightforward communication about life and ends with getting in a Jeep vehicle, that's the hook. It didn't require me to reintroduce myself, point to the fact that in my life I've been many things and known for specific projects or roles,"" Ford said in a statement. ""It's just a quiet talk from somebody sharing an idea. I love the way it developed.""
The Wrangler passing the Bronco is one of two references to the Jeep rival. The other comes from the actor at the end of the ad: ""Choose what makes you happy. My friends, my family, my work make me happy. This Jeep makes me happy — even though my name is Ford. That's my owner's manual. Get out there, write your own.""
The Jeep ad was shot over two days with Ford in Santa Clarita, California, in early December, according to Stellantis. 
Automotive has historically been one of the top segments for Super Bowl advertising. Even during the Great Recession in 2008 and 2009 when the industry was hit hard, several companies such as Toyota Motor, Hyundai Motor and Audi aired ads.
Francois believes other automakers likely didn't participate in the Super Bowl this year because of a lack of payoff in prior years, when many automakers, including Stellantis, touted all-electric vehicles that weren't on sale.
""In the last years, there was plenty of automakers, all of them [touting] EVs, EVs that didn't even exist,"" Francois said. ""These guys are obviously running like headless chickens: EVs, EVs, EVs. I mean, that's where we all were.""
Automakers regularly advertised during the NFL regular season and playoffs, including with sponsorships such as Toyota being the ""Official Automotive Partner of the NFL."" But none, other than Stellantis, advertised during Sunday's game.
Both of Stellantis' Super Bowl ads this year featured electric vehicles, but they also included traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines as well as plug-in hybrid models such as the Jeep Wrangler.
Francois said it may have been a blessing that Elkann called him in early December instead of months earlier because it allowed him to be more relevant in the messaging, rather than just touting EVs.
""The moment had changed, and I was lucky enough to have the possibility to rewrite the scripts. To rewrite history, to say, to not run like a headless chicken,"" Francois said. ""I was able to improvise in the moment.""
Stellantis declined to disclose how much money it spent on the production or broadcast of the ads, which were selling for up to $8 million for 30 seconds of air time during Super Bowl 59.
But Francois said Elkann has told advertising and marketing leaders at Stellantis that ""Marketing is no longer a cost. It is an investment.""
Correction: Jeep's Super Bowl ad was filmed in Santa Clarita, California. An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified the city."
Trump is unlikely to end Medicare drug price talks — here's what that means,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/10/trump-could-make-changes-to-medicare-drug-price-negotiations.html,Health and Science,Feb 10 20257:00 AM EST,"
President Donald Trump likely won't do away with a landmark process that allows Medicare to negotiate drug prices with manufacturers, even as he moves to erase Joe Biden's other historic policy accomplishments. 
But Trump will likely make some changes to those price talks, and it may not require help from Congress. 
""Trump is looking to nibble around the edges of the law,"" said Matthew Kupferberg, a partner in Frier Levitt's life sciences group, adding the president is ""not looking to completely abandon the drug negotiation process at this point.""
It's still unclear which way Trump will lean, however. While some lawmakers and health policy experts said Trump could weaken the negotiations in a way that helps the pharmaceutical industry, other experts said he could double down and try to save patients and the federal government even more money to outdo his predecessor. 
The path he takes could have huge stakes for the prices 68 million Medicare beneficiaries in the U.S. pay for their medications. It will also have big implications for companies like Novo Nordisk, Bristol Myers Squibb, Pfizer and Merck, among others whose drugs were included in the first two rounds of talks.
The negotiations are a key provision of Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, that aims to lower prescription medicine costs for seniors and save the government nearly $100 billion in Medicare spending over the next decade. The pharmaceutical industry fiercely opposes the price talks, arguing in a flurry of lawsuits that they threaten profits and discourage drug innovation.
The Trump administration has offered few specifics on its approach to the negotiations, apart from saying in January that it will aim for ""greater transparency"" in the ongoing second cycle of the process and hear any ideas for improving it from external stakeholders.
Making significant changes to the law or repealing it altogether would be an uphill battle because it requires help from Congress, where Republicans hold slim majorities. Reining in high health-care costs has strong bipartisan support in a nation where patients pay two to three times more for prescription drugs than people in other developed countries, making it a potentially unpopular move for Trump.
So the Trump administration could move to implement the provision differently than Biden did, including by changing how the government interprets the law's selection criteria for drugs, among other potential changes.
""I think it is a question of how they interpret some of the statutory language,"" said Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the program on Medicare policy at KFF, a health policy organization. 
Cubanski said we can expect a first glimpse at any changes in the coming months.
The Trump administration will start the monthslong negotiation process for a second cycle of 15 drugs, which will have new prices go into effect in 2027. The Biden administration selected those medicines in January before Trump took office. Drugmakers have until the end of February to decide whether to participate in the talks, which they likely will because they otherwise face stiff financial penalties.
Trump has so far only indicated the need for more transparency in Medicare drug price negotiations. Kupferberg said that could mean disclosing more information about the government's rationale for selecting drugs or settling on prices.
During the first round of the talks, Medicare provided opportunities for public input from patients, caregivers and consumer groups. But Kupferberg said the Trump administration could move to bring in other stakeholders beyond manufacturers and patients, like insurers or even middlemen called pharmacy benefit managers. 
""It could be a much broader type of negotiation process,"" he said. 
The administration could also reinterpret the guidelines of the law, which could change what products get selected and how much prices fall, according to Amy Campbell, associate dean for law and health sciences at the University of Illinois Chicago School of Law.
For example, the IRA says the drugs selected for negotiations must have been on the market for at least seven years without generic competitors, or 11 years in the case of biologic products such as vaccines. But the Trump administration, when selecting another round of drugs, may have ""looser standards"" for determining whether a drug has competition in the market and should be exempt from negotiated prices, Campbell said. 
Trump could also revise what Medicare considers one drug for the purpose of negotiations, KFF's Cubanski said. Currently, different products that share the same active ingredient can be selected as a single product, which the pharmaceutical industry opposes. 
The Biden administration, for example, included three of Novo Nordisk's branded medications with the same active ingredient – semaglutide – as one product in the second cycle of price talks. That includes the weight loss drug Wegovy, diabetes pill Rybelsus and the anti-obesity injection Ozempic. Of the three, Ozempic makes up the lion's share of Medicare spending.
Either of those changes to how Medicare selects drugs could benefit drugmakers and lessen the revenue they lose from lower prices. 
The bigger question is how aggressively Medicare will negotiate prices under Trump, Cubanski said. Currently, the final negotiated price for a drug cannot exceed an upper limit, or ""ceiling"" price, established by the IRA.
Trump could influence whether Medicare's initial price offer for a drug is closer to the ceiling price, which could weaken the program's ability to secure a deeper discount. 
Major changes to the price negotiations are much less likely to occur, as they would require help from Congress. For example, one of the pharmaceutical industry's biggest issues with the process is what drugmakers calls the ""pill penalty."" 
The law essentially spares biologics like vaccines from new negotiated prices for 13 years after they receive U.S. approval, compared with just nine years for small-molecule drugs that come in a pill or tablet form. The industry contends that the discrepancy discourages companies from investing in the development of small-molecule drugs, which are more convenient for patients.
Cubanski said bipartisan legislation was introduced last year that proposes eliminating the pill penalty. If that bill makes it through Congress and to Trump's desk, ""I don't see why he wouldn't sign it,"" Cubanski said. 
She added that there appears to be growing interest in legislative changes to the negotiation program, but ""whether you get enough support in Congress is still really an open question."" 
There isn't the same level of bipartisan support for changes to the IRA as there is for efforts like pharmacy benefit manager reform, said Jesse Dresser, partner in Frier Levitt's life sciences department. 
""I could see something like [PBM reform] happening a lot sooner than I could see trying to open up the IRA and tweak it, even if it's something that the administration might ultimately get behind,"" Dresser said. 
It's unclear how Trump will approach the ongoing legal fight between manufacturers and the federal government over the Medicare program.
The pharmaceutical industry's legal challenges, which argue that the talks are unconstitutional and should be stopped, have so far been unsuccessful in court. Nine lawsuits were ongoing as of January.
""Will the Trump administration continue to defend the program? Or maybe not as aggressively defend the program?"" Cubanski said. ""I think those are some key questions."" 
If the Trump administration stops defending the program in court, judges could then make decisions on the matter without any opposition, Kupferberg said. But he said he doesn't believe the administration will want that outcome. 
The Trump administration would likely ""want to take control of that process, where the parties work out an agreement or revise and change the interpretation of the law,"" Kupferberg said. 
He added that it doesn't seem like Trump would want the entire negotiation program to disappear based on the lawsuits. That's because it would leave Trump in the position to come up with a replacement for Medicare drug price negotiations, and we ""just haven't seen one yet"" from him, Kupferberg said. "
"McDonald's revenue disappoints, as U.S. sales see worst drop since pandemic",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/10/mcdonalds-mcd-q4-2024-earnings.html,Restaurants,Feb 10 202512:01 AM EST,"
In this article
McDonald's on Monday reported disappointing quarterly revenue, dragged down by weaker-than-expected sales at its U.S. restaurants following an E. coli outbreak just weeks into the quarter.
But shares of the company rose nearly 5% as executives predicted sales would improve in 2025.
Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:
Net sales of $6.39 billion were roughly flat compared with the year-ago period. The company's overall same-store sales growth of 0.4% outperformed Wall Street's expectations of same-store sales declines of 1%, according to StreetAccount estimates.
But McDonald's U.S. business reported a steeper-than-expected drop in its same-store sales. Same-store sales at the company's domestic restaurants fell 1.4% in the quarter; Wall Street was projecting same-store sales declines of 0.6%.
McDonald's said traffic was slightly positive, but customers spent less than usual during the quarter. Over the summer, the chain rolled out a $5 combo meal to bring back price-conscious diners and reverse sluggish sales. The strategy worked, helping McDonald's U.S. same-store sales tick up in the third quarter.
However, analysts have warned that value meals only work if customers also add menu items that aren't discounted to their orders. McDonald's executives downplayed those concerns Monday, saying the average check on the $5 meal deal is more than $10.
The biggest hit to McDonald's U.S. sales came in late October, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention linked a fatal E. coli outbreak to its Quarter Pounder burgers. McDonald's switched suppliers for its slivered onions, the ingredient fingered as the likely culprit for the outbreak. In early December, the CDC declared the outbreak officially over.
However, in the days following the news of the outbreak, traffic at McDonald's U.S. restaurants fell steeply, particularly in the states affected.
U.S. sales hit their nadir in early November, but began rising again after that. In particular, demand for the Quarter Pounder, a popular core menu item with high margins, fell quickly in the wake of the crisis.
McDonald's expects its U.S. sales to recover by the beginning of the second quarter, executives said.
""I think right now what we're seeing is that the E. coli impact is now just localized to the areas that had the biggest impact,"" CEO Chris Kempczinski said on the company's conference call. ""So think about that as sort of the Rocky Mountain region that was really the epicenter of the issue.""
The company hopes value deals, along with key menu additions, will help to fuel the recovery this year. In 2025, the burger chain plans to bring back its popular snack wraps, which vanished from menus during pandemic lockdowns, and to introduce a new chicken strip menu item.
Outside the U.S., sales were stronger. Both of McDonald's international divisions reported same-store sales increases, bolstering the company's overall performance.
The company's international developmental licensed markets segment, which includes the Middle East and Japan, reported same-store sales growth of 4.1%.
McDonald's international operated markets division, which includes some of its biggest markets, reported same-store sales growth of 0.1%. The company said most markets reported same-store sales increases, but the United Kingdom and some other markets saw same-store sales shrink in the quarter. One bright spot was France, which saw its same-store sales turn positive during the quarter after months of weak demand.
McDonald's reported fourth-quarter net income of $2.02 billion, or $2.80 per share, down from $2.04 billion, or $2.80 per share, a year earlier.
Excluding gains tied to the sale of its South Korean business, transaction costs for buying its Israeli franchise and other items, McDonald's earned $2.83 per share.
Looking to 2025, the first quarter is expected to be the low point for McDonald's same-store sales, CFO Ian Borden said, citing a weak start to the year in the U.S., among other factors. Winter storms and wildfires in California weighed on restaurant traffic across the industry in January.
For the full year, McDonald's plans to open roughly 2,200 restaurants. About a quarter of those locations will be in the U.S. and its international operated markets. The rest will be in the company's international developmental licensed markets, including about 1,000 new restaurants in China.
Including its investments in restaurant openings, McDonald's plans to spend between $3 billion and $3.2 billion this year on capital expenditures.
The company is also projecting a headwind of 20 cents to 30 cents per share to its full-year earnings due to foreign currency exchange rates."

Fashion's most hated garment — the skinny jean — is making a comeback,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/08/skinny-jeans-are-making-a-comeback.html,Retail,Feb 8 20258:00 AM EST,"
In this article
The vilified linchpin of millennial and Y2K fashion – the skinny jean – might be on its way to a comeback.
Over the last few months, a range of skinny styles, including pants and jeans, have cropped up on fashion runways, influencer videos and Google search trends, indicating the divisive garment could soon be a closet staple again. 
Part of the buzz around skinny jeans undoubtedly came when TikTok star and Gen Z influencer Alix Earle debuted a pair of exclusive skinnies with denim brand Frame at the end of January, but the hype was already building before that. 
""For like the last six months, we started to hear rumblings of skinny jeans making a comeback,"" said Janine Stichter, a retail analyst and managing director at BTIG. ""If you look at Google Trends data for skinny jeans ... it actually [spiked] the week of January 12 and it's been picking up steam ever since.""
The week after Earle debuted her skinny jean partnership with Frame, searches for skinny jeans were up 50% year over year, she added, but still well off their 2009 peak.
That likely led to a spike in interest across retailers. Reformation told CNBC this week its customers have been searching for skinny jeans on its website more frequently lately.
American Eagle has also seen interest grow. 
""Certainly, there's a lot of activity on skinny. I would like to say there's a styling thing that's happening, the high boot situation, and high boots and skinny jeans work, so that's definitely taking hold,"" Jen Foyle, American Eagle's president and executive creative officer, told CNBC in an interview.
""You're starting to see some of that movement but right now, it's still relatively small, but we're prepared to roll with it as we test it and scale,"" she continued. ""Our job is to be nimble, right?""
But like any fashion trend, the skinny jean resurgence was first spotted on the runways. Based on how the major designers are interpreting the look, it'll appear different this time around. 
""On the runways, Prada, Isabel Morant, Tod's, they all did very slim silhouette pants. They're calling them skinny pants. The difference is that they're doing them in plaid, not just solids. They're doing them in these very tailored fabrics,"" said Shawn Grain Carter, a fashion professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. ""We're seeing some of the celebrities wear these skinny jeans, but they're not nearly as conforming … it's different from the jeggings that you saw [between 2009 and 2011]... It conforms to the leg, but it doesn't have to necessarily hug it so tightly that all you see is an outline of a woman's leg.""
The unofficial queen of denim – Levi Strauss CEO Michelle Gass – spotted the same trend on the runways and told CNBC she expects the controversial jeans to officially come back ""sometime in the future.""
""While we don't have a crystal ball, don't get rid of your skinny jeans,"" said Gass. ""I do think when we see a bigger trend re-emerge, it's going to look and feel different."" 
Grain Carter said skinny styles could start appearing in stores more widely by this summer, but Stichter said they could start returning to shelves closer to the fall when more consumers are out shopping for pants and jeans. That'll be welcome news for apparel and footwear retailers because whenever trends shift, it tends to trigger a surge in demand for new clothes, she said. 
""If we are to get a full fledged restocking in any of these styles, it tends to be a big positive for the sector,"" said Stichter. ""Anytime you have a big silhouette shift, it's positive for restocking cycles. It's also positive for footwear because you need different footwear to go with the bottoms, and then you don't just buy the bottoms, you tend to need different tops to go with the bottom so it can kind of catalyze a whole closet refresh … That's kind of what we're looking out for."" 
For those who've only just stocked up their closet on baggy and loose fits, the current jean du jour, rest assured that there's room for both. If there's one thing that's started to define fashion, it's the lack of consensus among consumers of all age groups and styles, said Stichter.
Many shoppers never stopped wearing skinny jeans, and with the breakneck pace that trends move in the age of social media, fashion cycles can be resurrected before they're even dead. 
""The denim closet really should have all varieties of denim. It really is about what you're wearing, what your mood is, and people still wear skinny today,"" said Gass. ""So keep your loose, keep your baggie. Everything right now goes."" "
"Even at $8 million per Super Bowl ad, executives say it's bang for your buck",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/07/super-bowl-commercial-cost-ad-execs.html,CNBC Sport,Feb 7 202512:00 PM EST,"
In this article
Advertisers shelled out up to $8 million for a spot during Super Bowl 59. Ad industry executives still consider the price tag worth it, and argue it's even a bang for their buck.
The NFL's championship game between the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs will air this year on Fox Corp.'s broadcast network, as well as on Fox's free streamer Tubi. It'll likely be the biggest audience watching live television at the same time this year.
""The scale and buzz factor still delivers a punch,"" said Amy Leifer, DirecTV's chief advertising sales officer. ""Where else can you get 100 million viewers at once, right? Especially in this fragmented landscape ... there's virtually few places you can go to get that type of scale.""
Last year more than 123 million people tuned into the Super Bowl. The 2024 game racked up estimated ad revenue of about $550 million for in-game placements, according to GroupM, WPP's media investment group.
While advertisers have been spending more on digital, social media and streaming platforms, traditional TV is still considered the most ""effective"" form of advertising, meaning it has the biggest impact and results for brands due to the large audiences watching at once.
The ad market for traditional TV programming has slowed down as the cable bundle bleeds customers. Still, media companies with rights to live sports — as well as news and other live programming like awards shows — are able to nab a bigger chunk of ad dollars than peers without sports.
While it appears the ad market is stabilizing after a slowdown, networks and streamers with sports are sure to fare better than those without this year.
Sports have taken over the conversation at the advertising industry's Upfronts presentations each spring, when media companies make their pitch to advertisers. Fox sold most of the ad inventory for this year's Super Bowl during its Upfront last spring, CNBC previously reported.
The Super Bowl remains about three times as effective as the average primetime programming for advertisers, according to EDO, an advertising data company. The NFL's big game last year was 224% more effective than average primetime programming, the data firm said.
EDO likened the audience and engagement that comes with a Super Bowl game to an advertiser buying hundreds of spots on primetime. Based on last year's Super Bowl audience, EDO equated one ad during the big game to roughly 450 spots during primetime programming in terms of viewer engagement.
""It's a fair and rational price based on our data, which is that this has been one of the most consistent performers over time,"" said Kevin Krim, CEO of EDO. ""And there's room for the price to go up based on our data. But the important thing is, it matters a ton how a brand executes on their creative idea.""
For instance, when brands launch a new product during a Super Bowl commercial, consumers continue to engage with the brand via online searches or app visits even after the Super Bowl ad first aired, said Krim. He noted three recent brand launches during Super Bowl commercials — automaker Kia launching the EV6 in 2022, and Reese's unveiling its Big Caramel Cup and Popeye's promoting its new wings in 2024 — which led to a lift in engagement for each brand when the ads aired thereafter.
Even localized ads that are sold at a lower cost than national ads and only shown in certain markets experience a Super Bowl lift. Zeam, a hyperlocal streaming platform, aired a spot starring actor John Stamos in select markets last year.
The app had ""millions of downloads"" following the commercial, said Jack Perry, CEO of Zeam Media.
""It was good enough for us, and it's not cheap for us to buy those available spots. There's a very limited number of local spots during the game,"" said Perry.
Zeam will run another commercial with Stamos this year.
The placement of a commercial during the game, sometimes as specific as what time during a certain quarter the ad is shown, can make a difference, too, according to Andre Banks, founder and CEO of NewWorld, a marketing and strategy consultancy.
""If a brand wants to drive high-impact results, they must align their spots with when their target audience is most engaged, not the spot that receives higher viewership,"" said Banks.
He noted a portion of the Super Bowl audience each year tunes in specifically for the Halftime show, which this year features rapper Kendrick Lamar, and then turns their attentions away once the moment passes.
Banks also noted that social media plays a big role during the Super Bowl, with viewers turning to varying tech platforms during the game. Social media should be key for advertisers during the Super Bowl, too, he said.
""With so many viewers scrolling on social channels during the game, there's also a massive opportunity for brands to optimize for second-screen engagement,"" Banks added.
Ad spending on tech and social media platforms far eclipses traditional TV. GroupM estimates that ad revenue for ""pure-play digital,"" which excludes digital extensions of media companies like streaming, will grow 10% to $813.3 billion globally in 2025. By comparison, TV ad spend is expected to grow nearly 2% to $169.1 billion. Media companies have even recently come together to launch an ad platform with the aim of taking back share from tech players.
Some say brands' focus on spending big on the Super Bowl and the idea that traditional TV is the most effective form of advertising may lie in the past.
""I don't necessarily think when someone says it's still the most effective, that's what it is. I think what people are saying is it's the only place left where there is a really large, captive broadcast audience watching something,"" said Shoshana Winter, CEO of Converge, a performance marketing agency. ""When it comes to this particular thing, we are holding on hard and fast."""
Beauty stocks post major losses after a week of worrying results,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/07/beauty-stocks-post-major-losses.html,Retail,Feb 7 20254:40 PM EST,"
In this article
Several beauty stocks posted major losses this week, as companies such as E.l.f. Beauty and Estee Lauder reported disappointing earnings and cut guidance.
E.l.f. closed out its worst week since August 2018, with shares cratering nearly 29% over the five-day period. The cosmetics brand on Thursday posted a revenue beat for its fiscal third quarter, but missed on adjusted earnings per share and cut its full-year guidance to between $1.3 billion and $1.31 billion in sales, down from a prior range of between $1.32 billion and $1.34 billion.
CEO Tarang Amin told CNBC in an interview on the results that the cosmetics sector broadly declined 5% in January, which he attributed to a hangover from holiday discounting and a decrease in online attention to beauty products.
Analysts from Morgan Stanley, D.A. Davidson and UBS all downgraded the stock to neutral or equal weight following the report, citing the cut guidance.
Estee Lauder shares fell 22% on the week, marking that stock's worst week since November. The company on Tuesday said it would cut between 5,800 and 7,000 jobs by the end of fiscal 2026 and that softening travel retail demand in Asia would damage its net sales in the third quarter.
The news sent shares tumbling despite a beat on second-quarter revenue and earnings per share.
""Simply said, we lost our agility. We did not capitalize on the higher-growth opportunities,"" CEO Stéphane de La Faverie, who began in the position on Jan. 1, said on the earnings call.
Shares of Ulta Beauty and Coty also were under pressure this week, trimming 9% and nearly 8%, respectively, on the week. It was Ulta's worst week since April, and Coty's worst week since October.
On E.l.f. Beauty's earnings call Thursday, Amin said the company saw ""a little bit of softness"" at Ulta, one of the brand's retailers, in January.
The beauty sector, like others in the U.S., faces the threat of tariffs eating into its profits. China announced tariffs on select U.S. imports Tuesday in response to President Donald Trump's additional 10% tariffs on Chinese goods.
E.l.f., for example, manufactures about 80% of its products in China, but Amin told CNBC that the company was ""relieved"" to see Trump impose tariffs of just 10%, when he had previously floated levies as high as 60%.

San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy, the last pick in the 2022 National Football League draft, has become synonymous with flaws in NFL player evaluation. The team's president, Al Guido, hopes his organization can lean on artificial intelligence to improve talent assessment, both for football and for soccer.
Purdy, who led the 49ers to the Super Bowl last year, fell to the 262 overall pick, in part because scouting metrics failed to identify some of the traits that have made him a successful quarterback.
Scouting is even more difficult for soccer, Guido told CNBC Sport in an interview from Radio Row in New Orleans ahead of Super Bowl 59. (The 49ers' ownership group owns Leeds, the English football club.) That's because soccer is a global sport, played in dozens of leagues with various levels of competition.
""You could grow up anywhere and actually get on an English Premier League team,"" Guido said. ""So what are you thinking about from an advanced statistics perspective, to your scouting department, to how you us AI for all the different metrics that go into defining what a good player looks like?""
Marrying traditional scouting with ""the science,"" both for soccer and the NFL, has become a core tenet of the 49ers' evaluation process, said Guido.
Purdy is up for a contract extension this off-season. Guido declined to offer a timeline for a new deal, though he did say, ""I'm sure it'll get itself worked out."""

Bank stocks pop after Fed releases 'easier' 2025 stress test parameters,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/06/bank-stocks-fed-stress-test.html,Finance,Feb 6 20251:02 PM EST,"
Bank shares rose Thursday after the Federal Reserve released parameters for its annual industry stress test showing smaller hypothetical shocks to the U.S. economy than in previous years.
While still challenging, with U.S. joblessness jumping to 10% and a 33% drop in home prices, the 2025 exam has smaller spikes in unemployment and smaller declines in stock and real estate values than previous versions, Jason Goldberg of Barclays said Thursday in a note titled ""2025 Stress Test: Scenarios Easier than Past Two Years.""
The Fed will soon take steps to ""reduce the volatility of stress test results and begin to improve model transparency"" in the 2025 exam, the regulator said in a statement released Wednesday after the close of regular trading.
Shares of Citigroup jumped 2.9% in midday trading, while Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America each rose at least 1.5%. Big banks gained more than smaller lenders, with the KBW Bank Index rising 1.2% compared with the 0.9% gain of the S&P Regional Banking ETF.
The stress test changes bolster the case made by Wall Street analysts that big U.S. banks will face a friendlier regulatory regime under the Trump administration. Since the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the biggest U.S. banks have had to undergo annual exams that test their ability to withstand a severe recession while continuing to lend to consumers and businesses.
Banks have complained for years that the annual stress tests were opaque and unfairly administered, and industry trade groups sued the Fed in December over the exam.
By making the latest iteration of the test both less challenging and more predictable, banks could hold smaller capital cushions later this year, according to Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala.
""The 2025 stress test scenario, broadly better vs last year, increases our confidence that banks should begin to see relief on regulatory capital requirements, given our expectations for a shift to a balanced, transparent, and more predictable regulatory regime,"" Poonawala wrote Thursday in a note.

How Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger got caught in Trump's trade war with China,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/06/calvin-klein-owner-pvh-blacklisted-in-china.html,Retail,Feb 6 20258:13 AM EST,"
In this article
China has blacklisted the owner of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, which could force the company to shut down stores and manufacturing in an early repercussion of President Donald Trump's trade war. 
China added PVH Corp. to its ""unreliable entities"" list on Tuesday, which allows the Chinese government to fine the retailer, prohibit import and export activities, revoke work permits, and deny employees the ability to enter the country, among other deliberately vague powers. 
While China's Ministry of Commerce began investigating PVH in September for allegedly refusing to source cotton from the Xinjiang region, which has become notorious for its Uyghur detention camps, Beijing officially placed the company on its blacklist on Tuesday. The announcement came just days after Trump slapped a 10% tariff on imports from China, and came along with a slew of other retaliatory measures against the U.S., including new duties on energy imports and farm gear. 
""There's this tit-for-tat trade war going on, and [China] wants to show the United States that it's going to take action to hurt either big U.S. companies or companies with significant interests in the U.S.,"" said Michael Kaye, a partner at Squire Patton Boggs, who has been practicing international trade law for more than 30 years. ""They're being made an example. ... My guess is, [China] wanted to pick somebody and they wanted it to be somebody that was high visibility.""
Now that PVH is on the unreliable entities list, China could force the company to shut down the dozens of stores that it operates in the region and forbid it from selling its wares to Chinese consumers online, said Kaye. Its staff — including those who've built lives in China — could be effectively deported and sent home, Kaye added.
It is unclear if China would try to enforce actions against PVH in the autonomous region of Hong Kong, where the company's Asia-Pacific headquarters are. In 2020, China passed a law that gave it more power to enforce national laws in Hong Kong, and that is ""particularly the case with laws applicable to national security,"" which could include the unreliable entities list, said Kaye.
As of Thursday morning Eastern time, the company appeared to be operating its business as usual in China.
China could even prohibit PVH from manufacturing in the region altogether, which could force it to move production to other countries and struggle to meet customer orders. 
It's unclear which steps exactly China will take, or if the Trump administration will try to convince China not to punish the company.
In a statement, PVH said that it was ""surprised and deeply disappointed to learn of the decision from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce.""
""In our 20 years of operating in China and proudly serving our consumers, as a matter of policy, PVH maintains strict compliance with all relevant laws and regulations and operates in line with established industry standards and practices. We will continue our engagement with relevant authorities and look forward to a positive resolution,"" the company said.
China represented 6% of PVH's sales and 16% of its earnings before interest and taxes in 2023, but it relies more heavily on the country for manufacturing, which is the bigger risk to its business. PVH has more factories and suppliers in China than in any other region, representing about 18% of production, according to a disclosure it issued in December. 
""This has the potential to be very, very disruptive for PVH,"" said GlobalData managing director and retail analyst Neil Saunders. ""They would certainly have to scramble to find new capacity. They'd be able to do that in time, of course, but the two things that are at issue are that, because a lot of supply chains are just in time, they would probably find that they did get short on inventory whilst they made the transition. The other issue, of course, is quality."" 
PVH has operated in China for more than 20 years, and while it works with suppliers and factories in more than 30 other countries, the higher-end goods that it makes can be difficult to manufacture elsewhere because of the skill level needed, said Saunders. 
""While you can shift manufacturing capacity reasonably easily, it's not so easy to guarantee the quality, guarantee the production processes. Those things take time to upskill,"" said Saunders. ""China has that capacity and has those skills, because PVH has been operating there for ages. Another country, another manufacturing facility, may not have those skills immediately."" 
Plus, PVH has viewed China as a growth market and it will now have to look for new strategies to increase sales and profitability as demand falls for its high-end dresses, intimate apparel and sweaters. 
China's unreliable entities list is a relatively new law in the country, and experts say it's deliberately opaque. The government has wide latitude to take action against PVH, but it remains unclear what exactly it will do. Typically, guidance comes within a few days of a company's placement on the blacklist, said Kaye. 
China could add PVH to the list and do nothing to the company, but Kaye said the chances of that are ""very slim"" because the government will want to avoid the perception that it's backing down. China will more likely use PVH as a bargaining chip at the negotiating table with Trump, and use it as an example to show the power it has to inflict pain on other U.S. businesses with major operations and customer bases in China, such as Nike, Apple, General Motors, Starbucks and others. 
""There's a sort of sword of Damocles hanging over [PVH's] head, and that is exactly what this is, because this isn't really about PVH at all. This is about PVH being caught in the spat between China and the U.S.,"" said Saunders. ""China is using PVH as an example to say, look, if tariffs go ahead, if other restrictions are put in place on China, we can make life difficult for U.S. companies in the country. That's really what this is about."""
"New Orleans prepares for Super Bowl 59, its biggest weekend of the year ",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/06/super-bowl-59-new-orleans-prepares-for-blockbuster-weekend.html,CNBC Sport,Feb 6 20251:42 PM EST,"
In this article
New Orleans is preparing for an estimated 125,000 visitors and a presidential visit during the weekend of Super Bowl 59, as the reigning champion Kansas City Chiefs take on the Philadelphia Eagles at the Caesars Superdome.
Local businesses are ready, and hotel demand is surging.
Tripadvisor said demand for hotel rooms in New Orleans surged 637% this week as fans of the competing NFL teams scurry to find lodging. Interest from travelers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey has increased more than 14 times, and interest from people in Kansas and Missouri is up 8.5 times since the division championship games in the last week of January, the travel site said.
As of Thursday morning, the average hotel room was going for $650 per night, according to Hotels.com, which is owned by Expedia.
Caesars has the spotlight, however. Along with naming rights to the New Orleans Saints' stadium, where the NFL championship will be played, Caesars also holds lucrative status as the only casino in New Orleans.
The company has rolled out the red carpet with a nearly half-billion-dollar overhaul of what was formerly a Harrah's-branded property, and it is using the big game to introduce the brand to new customers.
The biggest football game of the year comes just weeks after a New Year's Day attack that took place in the city's French Quarter and killed 14 people, putting New Orleans on high alert.
Security around town is tight. State police, city police and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security all have a heavy presence.
At an NFL briefing on Monday, law enforcement said more than 700 different types of Homeland Security officials will be on the ground during the Super Bowl, and that was before President Donald Trump indicated plans to attend the game.
""I am confident that the safest areas to be in the country this weekend is under the security umbrella our team has put together,"" said Cathy Lanier, the NFL's chief security officer.
Since the Jan. 1 attack in New Orleans, NFL Executive Vice President Jeff Miller said the league has redoubled its safety efforts.
""We added resources, and we feel really good about where we are,"" Miller told CNBC."

Eli Lilly to release late-stage data on weight loss drug retatrutide in 2025,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/06/eli-lilly-to-release-weight-loss-drug-retatrutide-data-in-2025.html,Health and Science,Feb 6 20257:40 AM EST,"
In this article
Eli Lilly on Thursday said it expects to release data from a late-stage trial on its next-generation weight loss drug retatrutide later this year, a few months earlier than anticipated. 
The company expects to provide results from a 68-week study in people with obesity and osteoarthritis of the knee in 2025, according to fourth-quarter earnings slides on its website. Eli Lilly previously said that phase three study was expected to finish in February 2026. 
It is among at least nine closely watched clinical trials on retatrutide, which works differently from the obesity and diabetes treatments on the market and appears to be even more effective at weight loss. 
""We believe this potential new medicine can deliver even more weight loss than tirzepatide and it could potentially provide additional health benefits,"" Daniel Skovronsky, Lilly's chief scientific and medical officer, said during an earnings call on Thursday.
Retatrutide is a key part of Eli Lilly's drug pipeline that could help the company maintain its dominance in the blockbuster weight loss and diabetes treatment space and gain an edge over key competitor Novo Nordisk.
Dubbed the ""triple G"" drug, retatrutide works by mimicking three hunger-regulating hormones: GLP-1, GIP and glucagon. That appears to have more potent effects on a person's appetite and satisfaction with food than other treatments.
Tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Eli Lilly's weight loss shot Zepbound and diabetes drug Mounjaro, mimics two of the hormones, GLP-1 and GIP. Novo Nordisk's weight loss drug Wegovy mimics only GLP-1.
Retatrutide appears to cause even greater weight loss than tirzepatide, which has skyrocketed in demand in the U.S.
Retatrutide helped patients lose 24.2% of their body weight, or 58 pounds, on average after 48 weeks in a midstage trial on adults who were obese or overweight. Those who took the placebo lost 2.1% of their body weight after that same time period.
Higher doses of tirzepatide helped patients with obesity lose up to 22.5% of their body weight on average in late-stage studies.

Strong Taco Bell sales fuel Yum Brands earnings beat,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/06/yum-brands-yum-earnings-q4-2024.html,Restaurants,Feb 6 20257:22 AM EST,"
In this article
Yum Brands on Thursday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street estimates, fueled by strong sales for KFC's international restaurants and Taco Bell.
Shares of the company rose more than 7% in morning trading.
Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:
The restaurant company reported fourth-quarter net income of $423 million, or $1.49 per share, down from $463 million, or $1.62 per share, a year earlier. Excluding refranchising gains and other items, Yum earned $1.61 per share.
Net sales climbed 16% to $2.36 billion. More than half of Yum's quarterly sales were digital, which includes online and delivery orders and those placed through in-store kiosks.
Yum's same-store sales rose 1% in the quarter, thanks to Taco Bell.
Taco Bell reported same-store sales growth of 5%. Executives have previously credited the chain's strong value perception for its success in recent quarters.
KFC's same-store sales were flat for the quarter, but the fried chicken chain saw stronger demand outside of the U.S. For example, in China, its largest market, KFC's system sales increased 5% in the quarter. Europe and Latin America reported double-digit system sales growth. The chain's international same-store sales rose 1% overall in the quarter.
Meanwhile, in its home market, KFC's U.S. same-store sales slid 5%. Popeyes has overtaken KFC to become the second-biggest chicken chain in the U.S., and other upstarts, like Raising Cane's, have been growing quickly. Yum has tapped Taco Bell's North American president, Scott Mezvinsky, as the new chief executive of KFC, starting in March.
Pizza Hut, the laggard of Yum's portfolio, reported same-store sales declines of 1% for the quarter. The pizza chain's U.S. same-store sales fell 2%, while its international business reported flat same-store sales.
""In the U.S., sales remained under pressure due to more value competition across both the QSR industry and the pizza category,"" Yum CEO David Gibbs said on the company's conference call. ""We've seen that everyday value offerings such as the $7 Deal Lovers effectively drive repeat visits from existing consumers. However, to attract lighter, lapsed consumers, we must lean further into disruptive and distinctive value promotions.""
Yum opened 1,804 new restaurants during the quarter, growing its unit count by 5%.
The company is also rolling out Byte, its proprietary artificial intelligence-driven software for Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC. For example, the tech makes it easier for consumers to place digital orders and reduces complexity in the kitchen for employees, executives said.
""We're giving our franchisees a much more turnkey solution that gives us more capability in terms of how we can grow,"" Gibbs said."
Peloton shares surge 12% as it edges toward profitability,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/06/peloton-pton-q2-2025-earnings.html,Retail,Feb 6 20257:17 AM EST,"
In this article
Peloton told investors Thursday it still has a ""steep hill to climb"" to achieve profitable growth under its new CEO and won't be ready to focus on boosting sales until it fixes its balance sheet.
The bike maker posted mixed fiscal second-quarter results, as it topped Wall Street's sales estimates but lost more than expected as it continued its efforts to make its costly hardware business more profitable.
The company also cut costs in three key areas that it has faced criticism for spending too much on – marketing, administrative costs, and research and development – leading it to blow away analyst expectations for adjusted EBITDA. 
In his first earnings call as Peloton's CEO, Peter Stern said that work is only going to grow.
""While we are working on our long-term growth strategy for fiscal 26 and beyond, our financial goals for fiscal 25 and continued discipline toward improving gross margins, reducing operating costs and deleveraging our balance sheets are and will remain top priorities for me,"" said Stern.
Peloton shares closed more than 12% higher Thursday.
Here's how Peloton performed in its fiscal 2025 second quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:
The company's reported net loss for the three-month period that ended Dec. 31 was $92 million, or 24 cents per share, compared with $195 million, or 54 cents per share, a year earlier. 
Sales dropped to $674 million, down more than 9% from $744 million a year earlier.
Peloton issued mixed guidance that indicated sales growth is still a ways out, but may stabilize by the end of the year, as it lasers in on growing free cash flow and adjusted earnings. It's projecting sales in the current quarter to be worse-than-expected at a range between $605 million and $625 million, compared to the $652 million analysts had expected, according to LSEG.
However, it anticipates adjusted EBITDA will be between $70 million and $85 million, far better than the $50.4 million Wall Street expected, according to StreetAccount.
Peloton anticipates fiscal 2025 revenue to be roughly in line with expectations. It's forecasting sales to be between $2.43 billion and $2.48 billion, compared with estimates of $2.47 billion, according to LSEG. 
Peloton in recent years has tried to reclaim the supercharged growth that it saw during the pandemic, but now the company is moving away from that strategy in favor of profitability. Sales of its connected fitness products are still falling, and exercise buffs are back in the gym and no longer see as much use for at-home equipment.
However, it draws about $1.7 billion in recurring, high-margin subscription revenue and more than $1.1 billion in gross profit from that side of the business. If it can reduce costs, investors see potential in Peloton's strategy.
In October, Peloton announced that Stern, a former Ford executive and co-founder of Apple Fitness+, would be its next CEO and president after Barry McCarthy stepped down earlier in the year and two board members briefly took the helm. 
Peloton selected Stern in part because of his time running Ford's subscription business. He's expected to use that experience to grow member satisfaction and create new offerings that keep customers from pausing or canceling their monthly subscriptions.
During Peloton's earnings call, Stern made it clear that the company is tripling down on profitability. When asked when the company is going to start thinking about growth, he said he wasn't yet ready to talk about it but is putting in the groundwork now.
""I want to take a beat on unit economics and right sizing our costs, because both of these are foundational for us to address before we can return to growth,"" said Stern. ""We're setting the stage to be able to grow while ensuring ... we'll have the financial capacity that we need to make investments that have strong returns.""
During the quarter, Peloton blew away adjusted EBITDA expectations. It posted $58.4 million in adjusted EBITDA, more than double the $26.7 million that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. It managed to eke out the number even with a wider-than-expected loss per share by reducing costs in areas that investors and analysts have said Peloton was overspending in. 
Sales and marketing costs were down 34%, general and administrative expenses fell 18%, and research and development spending dropped 25%, leading total operating expenses to be down 25% compared with the year-ago period.
Still, finance chief Liz Coddington acknowledged the company still has more work to do.
""While we're pleased with this progress that we've made, we do see further opportunities for cost optimizations, and we've built a culture of cost discipline into our company. We know that our [operating expenses] as a percent of revenue is still too high overall for the long term, and especially that's true within our [general and administrative] area,"" Coddington told analysts.
""We do see multiple opportunities to right size it,"" pointing to areas where technology can substitute for manual, employee labor and corporate real estate expenses as two examples.
Peloton's holiday quarter is typically its strongest for hardware sales, but most of its revenue decline came from that side of the business, as sales fell about 21%. 
However, it is making more than it used to from selling its pricey stationary bikes and treadmills, which have long been a money-losing business. During the quarter, its connected fitness gross margin came in at 12.9%, the first time it's reached double digits in more than three years, the company said. 
Peloton also saw big gains from its seasonal partnership with Costco, which drove more Bike+ sales during its holiday quarter than any other third-party retailer it works with, such as Amazon and Dick's Sporting Goods.

DETROIT — Ford Motor beat Wall Street's top- and bottom-line expectations for the fourth quarter but forecast a tougher year ahead for the company, as CEO Jim Farley promises improvements in vehicle quality and costs.
Shares of Ford fell 5% in after-hours trading.
Ford's forecast this year calls for adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, of $7 billion to $8.5 billion; adjusted free cash flow of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion; and capital expenditures between $8 billion and $9 billion.
For 2024, Ford reported adjusted EBIT of $10.2 billion, or $1.84 in adjusted earnings per share, and net income of $5.9 billion, or $1.46 in earnings per share. The automaker reported total revenue, including its financial arm, was a company record of $185 billion, and adjusted free cash flow was $6.7 billion.
""We think it's prudent. There's a lot of external factors … but our future is really in our hands,"" Farley said Wednesday during CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" on the cautionary guidance. 
Here's how the company performed in the fourth quarter compared with average estimates compiled by LSEG:
The company said its 2025 guidance, which is in line with or lower than many analysts' expectations, ""presumes headwinds related to market factors."" They include 2% industry lower pricing and slightly lower wholesales for Ford but not additional tariffs by the Trump administration.
""Given the pause in the current tariff situation, specifically in Mexico and Canada, we are not choosing to take any actions at this time,"" Ford Chief Financial Officer Sherry House told media on Wednesday during a call. ""We're going to let this run itself out so we can better understand the potential impacts on our business.""
House said this year's forecast also takes into account expectations of a $1 billion reduction in material and warranty costs compared with last year. This follows $1.4 billion in cost reductions in 2024, which were largely offset by unexpected quality and warranty costs.
The first half of 2025 is expected to be weaker than the backend. That includes first-quarter adjusted EBIT that is projected to be roughly breakeven due to lower wholesales and less profitable vehicles being produced, including launch activity at major U.S. assembly plants in Kentucky and Michigan.
For the fourth quarter of 2024, Ford reported net income of $1.8 billion, or 45 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $526 million, or a loss of 13 cents per share, a year earlier. Adjusting for one-time items, the company reported earnings per share of 39 cents.
Ford's traditional ""Blue"" operations and ""Pro"" fleet businesses carried the automaker to profitability, as its ""Model e"" electric vehicle business lost $5.08 billion in 2024, including $1.39 billion during the fourth quarter.
Its Blue business, which includes internal combustion engine vehicles, earned $5.28 billion in 2024, a nearly $2.2 billion decrease from the year before. Pro earned more than $9 billion last year, including $1.63 billion in the fourth quarter.
For 2025, Ford is forecasting EBIT of $7.5 billion to $8 billion from Ford Pro; $3.5 billion to $4 billion for Ford Blue; and a loss of $5 billion to $5.5 billion for Ford Model e. Its Ford Credit arm is expected to post earnings of $2 billion.
Ford was under pressure to perform after crosstown rival General Motors easily topped Wall Street's fourth-quarter expectations and said its 2025 guidance is in line with or above analysts' expectations.
Ford underperformed expectations last year largely due to unexpected warranty and recall problems plaguing the company's earnings. Shares of the automaker declined nearly 20% in 2024 amid the problems, which Farley has promised to rectify."
"Trump China tariffs will affect Ford, GM vehicles and auto parts",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/05/trump-china-tariffs-ford-gm-vehicles.html,Autos,Feb 5 20252:35 PM EST,"
In this article
DETROIT — President Donald Trump's move Saturday to impose 10% additional tariffs on imports from China affects a small number of U.S. vehicles. But those tariffs are also hitting auto parts, which could increase already heightened vehicle prices for consumers.
The U.S. in recent years has imported from about $15.4 billion to more than $17.5 billion worth of transportation goods from China each year, including $9 billion to $10 billion per year in auto parts and accessories for vehicles and tractors, among other special purpose vehicles, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission.
The biggest impact on vehicles will be on Ford Motor's Lincoln Nautilus and General Motors' Buick Envision. Those crossovers accounted for 83,884, or 95%, of the 88,515 China-made vehicles that were sold in the U.S. last year.
""It's mainly GM and Ford that are really hit from a volume standpoint,"" said Jeff Schuster, GlobalData vice president of automotive research. ""Our domestic guys are the ones taking the brunt of this, at least for full vehicles ... but it can be muted to some extent.""
Other carmakers such as Volvo, which is owned by China's Geely and its electric vehicle spin-off Polestar, import far fewer vehicles to the U.S. They've also changed production plans to reduce the number of vehicles being imported from China. That's especially true for EVs, given the Biden administration's 100% tariff last year on such models from China.
Ford incoming CFO Sherry House said Wednesday the automaker will ""assess the situation"" of tariffs on China goods ""as it plays out, including the response from China, and evaluate whether or not it affects"" the company's import and export strategy.
Spokespeople for Ford and GM declined to comment on potential changes to production or prices for their China-made vehicles. Volvo and Polestar did not respond.
China-made vehicles for consumers only represented 0.6% of the roughly 16 million new vehicles sold in 2024 in the U.S., according to GlobalData. That's about the same as imports from the United Kingdom, Sweden and Slovakia.
Tariffs on Canada or Mexico — which GlobalData reports accounted for 23.4% of U.S. sales last year — would have a far greater impact on the U.S. car market.
""While vehicle imports are minimal from China, auto parts imports are about ~$15-20 bn per year per the US International Trade Commission, and China is a key part of the battery/storage supply chain (especially LFP batteries used in utility scale energy storage),"" Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney said Sunday in an investment note.
It's unclear how much of an impact tariffs could have on batteries or raw materials for EVs, which are experiencing a slower-than-expected adoption.
But many electrified vehicles in the U.S. feature a notable percentage of components from China, according to data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. They include the Genesis G80 EV (25%); Hyundai Kona EV (50%) and Hyundai Ioniq 5 N (30%; ); Kia EV9 (35%) and Niro Electric (25%); Nissan Ariya EV (40%); Toyota bZ4x EV (20%) and RAV4 PHEV (20%); and Volkswagen ID Buzz EV (25%).
Mike Jackson, executive director of strategy and research for MEMA Original Equipment Suppliers, said the auto association is ""concerned"" about tariffs in general. He said while the 10% additional tariff on China isn't as impactful as ones in North America, it increases costs.
""It's a challenge. It represents a higher cost, and that cost is going to have to be borne,"" Jackson told CNBC on Wednesday on the sidelines of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago's auto conference in Detroit. ""Clearly China continues to contribute very valuable content. They've optimized for electronics and a wide range of aspects.""
Whether automakers decide to pass increases in costs on to consumers, change sourcing or take other actions is yet to be seen.
Passing the costs on to consumers could be troublesome for sales. New vehicle prices remain historically elevated at around $50,000, according to Cox Automotive.
""There's not a specific item coming from China that's under this tariff that says, 'Oh, no, this is the thing that's going to mess everything up' ... but they will drive up costs,"" said Stephanie Brinley, principal automotive analyst at S&P Global Mobility. ""It plays into a broader issue, a broader problem with pricing.""
Brinley said such price increases could affect new U.S. vehicle sales, which S&P Global Mobility prior to any tariffs forecast to be 16.2 million vehicles."
"Novo Nordisk CEO says he's confident about Wegovy supply, next-generation drugs",https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/05/novo-nordisk-earnings-ceo-lars-fruergaard-jorgensen-discusses-wegovy.html,Health and Science,Feb 5 20253:15 PM EST,"

It's been a rocky few months for Novo Nordisk.
Prescription data from IQVIA suggests Novo's obesity drug Wegovy is losing ground to rival Zepbound from Eli Lilly. Wegovy's potential successor, CagriSema, came up short of investor expectations in a closely watched Phase 3 trial. Novo's stock has fallen more than 20% over the last year, and people feared things would get even worse when the company released fourth-quarter earnings and its 2025 outlook on Wednesday.
Instead, Novo beat fourth-quarter expectations and provided a sales growth forecast between 16% and 24% – in line with the 20% Wall Street was looking for. Novo's stock rose more than 4% on Wednesday.
In an interview with CNBC, Novo Chief Executive Officer Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen brushed off concerns that Novo is falling behind Lilly.
""We are quite confident that as we move into the year and we'll be supplying more and more of the starter doses, we can see a nice step up in our volume and serving more and more patients,"" Jorgensen said. ""And the guidance we have given for this year, you can say, testifies to an underlying significant ramp in our business. So we're quite confident both in the demand in the market and also our ability to supply and compete in that market.""
People taking Wegovy start off on the lowest dose – or the starter dose – then work their way up to stronger formulations so their bodies can get used to the drug. At times, Novo has limited the amount of starter doses it shipped because it struggled to make enough of the drug and wanted to make sure people who were already on the medication could stay on it.
Novo's 2025 sales guidance implies a 30% increase in the number of patients taking one of the company's GLP-1 drugs, such as Ozempic, the company said on its earnings call.
The company also tried to reassure investors about CagriSema's effectiveness. Jorgensen said some people lost weight very quickly, and another group lost weight continuously, showing no sign of stopping by the time the trial ended, so they might need longer treatment.
""I'm very confident in the potency of the biology we have here,"" he said.
People are watching an earlier-stage treatment – amycretin – even closer. That experimental drug recently showed promising results in a phase 1b/2a trial.
Jorgensen said Novo is talking to the FDA about possibly moving straight to a phase three trial."
